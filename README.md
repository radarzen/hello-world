# hello-world
This is the demonstration tutorial for GitHub.

Hello all!  I am an amateur programmer that just likes to learn and have fun.  I have never programmed anything of significance, but I hope to at least be able to help out with projects someday!

I am interested in lower level languages (mosly C and C++) just because I like the idea of really controlling the machine.  I am also interested in Python for quick scripting with more options than simply BASH scripts.  One of my main problems is I have too many interests and keep jumping around.  For now, I want to concentrate on C, learning programming flow/design, etc.  I've read it's a bad idea to start with C, but I have a history of messing around in C and Assembly for small projects, so it feels more natural to me for now.
